## 🔍 Overview

Food Mood App is a web application built with Flask that recommends restaurants based on a user’s **current mood** and **location**.  
Built during the Foursquare Places API Hackathon, the concept was selected in the *first stage* as a promising prototype.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Back-end:** Flask (Python)  
- **Front-end:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Bootstrap  
- **API:** Foursquare Places API for location-based restaurant data  
- **Features:** Mood input, Geolocation, Restaurant results with ratings & price levels

This project implements an AI-powered **Smart Traffic Management System** designed to reduce urban congestion using  
**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**, **YOLO-based Computer Vision**, and **large-scale traffic simulation**.

Each traffic signal acts as an intelligent RL agent trained using the **AttendLight** algorithm in a hybrid  
**CityFlow + SUMO** simulation environment. Real-time vehicle counts and congestion levels are extracted from  
CCTV feeds using **YOLO + OpenCV**, enabling live, adaptive traffic control.

A monitoring **dashboard** displays congestion heatmaps, intersection states, and agent decisions, allowing  
traffic authorities to supervise and override signals in real time.
