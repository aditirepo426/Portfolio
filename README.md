This project implements an AI-powered **Smart Traffic Management System** designed to reduce urban congestion using  
**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**, **YOLO-based Computer Vision**, and **large-scale traffic simulation**.

Each traffic signal acts as an intelligent RL agent trained using the **AttendLight** algorithm in a hybrid  
**CityFlow + SUMO** simulation environment. Real-time vehicle counts and congestion levels are extracted from  
CCTV feeds using **YOLO + OpenCV**, enabling live, adaptive traffic control.

A monitoring **dashboard** displays congestion heatmaps, intersection states, and agent decisions, allowing  
traffic authorities to supervise and override signals in real time.
